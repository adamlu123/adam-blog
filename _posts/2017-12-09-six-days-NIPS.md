This year, NIPS conference 

During the past week, Long Beach, California hosts the 31st annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2017), with over 8000 attendees. I am going to write a series of posts highlighting interesting papers and talks with focus on GAN, approximate inference and computer vision.
