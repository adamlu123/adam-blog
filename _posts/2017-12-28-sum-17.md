2017 is another productive year in machine learning (especially deep learning) world. Several blogs have been written to summarize the new research ideas and development in the past year. I recommend the blogs by [Alex](https://blog.goodaudience.com/ai-in-2018-for-researchers-8955df0caaf9) and [Eduard](https://blog.statsbot.co/deep-learning-achievements-4c563e034257). They both mention some advancements in computer vision, NLP and GANs. 

Having been in the stats department at UCI for more than one year, I feel like I am on the road to become a (religiously) bayesian. When a new model comes in, I ask: can it be bayesian.
